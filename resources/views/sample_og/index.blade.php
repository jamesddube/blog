                            It takes a lot of effort, and six to eight years of studying, just to obtain a qualification of a
                            pharmacist. One spends years at school and once he finally graduates, he finds himself in a big
                            debt. Many people invested significant amount of time and money just to find themselves unemployed.
                            They didnot get a job of a pharmacist, because of oversaturated job market. But how is it possible?
                            There is a pharmacy on every corner, isn’t it?
